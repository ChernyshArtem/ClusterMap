/// `ClusterAlignment` is a wrapper around a `ClusterAlignmentStrategy` implementation. It is responsible for
/// determining the position of the cluster icon based on the geographical coordinates of its constituent annotations.
///
/// - Note: You can initialize `ClusterAlignment` with any object conforming to `ClusterAlignmentStrategy`.
/// This allows for custom alignment strategies.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```swift
/// let myAlignmentStrategy = MyCustomAlignmentStrategy()
/// let clusterAlignment = ClusterAlignment(alignmentStrategy: myAlignmentStrategy)
///
/// // Use clusterAlignment in ClusterManager
/// let customConfig = Configuration(
///     clusterAlignment: clusterAlignment
/// )
/// let manager = ClusterManager(configuration: customConfig)
/// ```

    /// annotation in the cluster.
